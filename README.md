New Business Development in the GenAI Era
Redefining the "Operating System" of Innovation.

## 1. Introduction
We are rewriting the OS of business creation.
In the GenAI era, the goal is not just efficiency, but achieving **"Depth" (Insight)** and **"Velocity" (Speed)** simultaneously.

## 2. The Golden Rule: 10:80:10
The role of the professional shifts from "Doing" to "Orchestrating".

| Ratio | Owner | Role |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **10%** | **Human** | **The Will (問いを立てる)**<br>Defining the core question and intent. |
| **80%** | **AI** | **The Acceleration (具体化)**<br>Execution, Coding, and Research at overwhelmed speed. |
| **10%** | **Human** | **The Decision (意思決定)**<br>Critical thinking and final judgment. |

> **"Human-in-the-loop"** is the condition for professionals.

## 3. Architecture: The Project Brain
We do not just save "Results"; we archive the entire **"Trajectory (Process)"**—including hesitation, failures, and dialogue—into a database (NotebookLM) to build a **"Project Brain"**.

```mermaid
graph TD
    %% Styles
    classDef human fill:#000,stroke:#fff,stroke-width:2px,color:#fff;
    classDef ai fill:#fff,stroke:#000,stroke-width:2px,color:#000;
    classDef db fill:#f9f9f9,stroke:#333,stroke-width:1px,stroke-dasharray: 5 5;

    %% Nodes
    H("Human / Will & Decision"):::human
    A("AI Agents / Context Engineering"):::ai
    P["Prototype / MVP"]
    M("Market / Validation"):::db
    DB[("Project Brain / NotebookLM")]:::db

    %% The Flow
    H -- "10%: Define Context" --> A
    A -- "80%: Vibe Coding & Execution" --> P
    P -- "Deploy" --> M
    M -- "Feedback & Raw Data" --> DB
    
    %% The Loop
    DB -. "Context & Trajectory" .-> A
    DB -. "Insight Extraction" .-> H
    H == "10%: Pivot Decision" ==> A
```

## 4. Democratization of Development
Business architects can now build functional prototypes instantly using AI Agents (Bolt, Claude Code, etc.).
We use **"Working Prototypes"** to hack the stakeholder's "Right Brain" and accelerate validation.
