## Introduction: New Business Development in the Age of Generative AI

The essence of new business development has not changed in the age of generative AI.<br>
Building new businesses remains a fundamentally human endeavor.<br>
**Decision** and **Will** are non-negotiable requirements.<br>

What has changed is everything else. The traditional approach — spending months on market research, crafting the perfect PowerPoint plan, and waiting for approval before writing a single line of code — is no longer just "too slow." It is **wrong**.<br>

We need a new operating system.<br>
We call it **"Depth & Velocity."**<br>

## The Framework: The 10:80:10 Rule

**Depth & Velocity** is a methodology that fundamentally redefines who does what in new business development.

- **The First 10% (The Will):** Only humans can define the "Why." It takes something close to obsession to give a project its initial momentum.
- **The Middle 80% (The Acceleration):** Research, analysis, prototyping, coding, and validation. AI agents handle all of it. What used to take months now takes days.
- **The Last 10% (The Decision):** Humans decide whether to ship. Ethical responsibility. The courage to launch — and the courage to kill.

## Three Principles

### 1. Don't think, then build. Build, then think.

Stop polishing your business plan. Build a working prototype on Day 1. The prototype will teach you what the market actually wants. AI has made this possible at near-zero cost.

### 2. Manage context, not tasks.

Throw away your Gantt charts. What matters in the AI era is **context** — meeting logs, user interviews, market signals. Feed everything into a "Project Brain." AI agents will retrieve what's needed instantly.

### 3. Hack the boardroom.

The biggest killer of corporate innovation is not the market. It is the **approval gate.** Executives reject what they cannot feel. Don't bring a slide deck — bring a working app on a smartphone. The room shifts from critique to excitement.

## Who This Is For

- **Corporate innovators** told to "do something with AI" but given no playbook
- **Intrapreneurs** fighting approval gates without the right ammunition
- **Startup founders** looking to systematize AI-native product development
