## Introduction: New Business Development in the Age of Generative AI

The essence of new business development has not changed in the age of generative AI.<br>
Building new businesses remains a fundamentally human endeavor.<br>
**Decision** and **Will** are non-negotiable requirements.<br>

What has changed is everything else. The traditional approach — spending months on market research, crafting the perfect PowerPoint plan, and waiting for approval before writing a single line of code — is no longer just "too slow." It is **wrong**.<br>

We need a new operating system.<br>
We call it **"Depth & Velocity."**<br>

## Read the Manifesto
